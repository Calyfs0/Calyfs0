            I am a programmer by habit. But apart from it I love mentoring
            people, working with startups, helping people wherever I can. I am
            very well versed with full stack development means
            web/desktop/mobile/cloud/meta. I am addicted a lot to ❤ coffee ❤.
            <strong>P.S: Don't think I am a nerd :D</strong>
